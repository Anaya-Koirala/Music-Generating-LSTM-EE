# Music Generation using LSTM-RNN
Part of my IBDP Extended Essay research. I aimed to explore how neural networks could replicate the musical and compositional styles of certain composers (in this case Bach).

## Contents
- ``content/bach_dataset`` Contains the dataset, both processed and unprocessed in midi format

- ``output/``: A selections of the music generated in .mp3 format. 

- ``output-midi/``: Midi versions of the music in ``output/``.

- ``EE.ipynb``: Jupyter notebook code for the main neural network. Forked from [tensor flow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/music_generation).

- ``EE_Stats.ipynb``: Tool custom created for statistical analysis of the generated music.

## Samples
- [Sample 1](output/1.mp4)
- [Sample 2](output/2.mp4)
- [Sample 3](output/3.mp4)
- [Sample 4](output/4.mp4)
- [Sample 5](output/5.mp4)
- [Sample 6](output/6.mp4)
